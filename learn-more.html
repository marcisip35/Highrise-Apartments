                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>Established by Terry Hui in 1977. Terry Hui started buying properties and renting out rooms in Vancouver as a way to make passive income. Soon enough Terry Hui got addicted in becoming a real estate agent and helping immigrants settle in Vancouver. Terry Hui founded the company just months later in the same year. In 1987 just 10 years after Highrise Apartments was founded, it lay claim to 40% of the apartment properties in downtown Vancouver.</p>
                    <h1>1990s</h1>
                    <p>The 1990s was a big turning point for Terry as he expanded across Canada exponentialy, by 1992 Terry had over 100+ properties across Canada and had claim to around 25% of luxury apartments and condo's in Vancouver and Toronto.</p>
                    <h2>The 2000s</h2>
                    <p>By the early 2000s Terry had properties in all of Canada's provinces, his model of taking care of his clients with exceptional customer service proves to be the driving factor. He also expanded in the United States across 30 different states by 2007 and had over 2000+ employees and 500 realtors. Despite that Highrise Apartments was becoming the largest real estate company in North America. It was barely raking in profits, because the company wanted to keep rent prices low while the quality high.</p>
